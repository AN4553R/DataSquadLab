# Data Squad - Platform Lab

## Live Coding: Building a Cloud Platform with AWS EKS and DevOps Tools
This is your one-stop shop to learn how to build a scalable and secure cloud platform with AWS EKS and essential DevOps tools. We'll dive deep into a live, interactive environment, so get ready to code alongside us!

### What We'll Be Building:
#### DevOps Tools: üõ†Ô∏è
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Terraform üìú
- Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): GitHub/GitHub Actions ‚öôÔ∏è
- Observability: Prometheus, Loki, Grafana üìä
- Deployment Management: ArgoCD
#### Backend Configuration:
- Database (DB): Postgres RDS
- Application (App): Spring application deployed on Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
#### Data Platform Components:
- Data Lake: Amazon S3
- Orchestration: Airflow
- ELT Process: DBT
- Data Ingestion: AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)
- Data Warehouse (DWH): Amazon Redshift
- Reporting Tool: Metabase

## Why Follow Along?
- Learn by Doing: Forget pre-recorded perfection. We'll embrace the "real world" by encountering and fixing errors together, providing valuable troubleshooting experience.
- Hands-on Learning: Create an AWS account and follow along with the steps. This is your chance to build your own platform alongside us!
- Focus on Practical Skills: We'll prioritize the tools and techniques you can use immediately, not just theoretical concepts.
- Beginner-Friendly: No prior knowledge of everything is required. We'll break down complex topics into manageable steps.
- Embrace Mistakes: Learning happens through doing, and making mistakes is inevitable. We'll learn from them together!
- Peer Programming: This live format fosters collaboration and discussion, encouraging peer programming techniques.

## Questions
- [ ] Should we have one account for dev, uat, and prod?
- [ ] How to do inplace modification for critical usecases? Ex. Change storage for the database
- [ ] Can we use advanced analytics window functions on mongo DB?
